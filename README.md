## Hi!
I'm currently working on learning the fundamentals of full-stack development using the MERN Stack. I'm learning alongside some great students at Code Fellows, so feel free to check out our code. There will be plenty of it in the weeks to come!

## Interests
I love IoT, home automation, and pretty much anything tech related, and I can't wait to meet others with similar interests and contribute to some open source projects!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on digging into React and the differences between class-based components and functional components with hooks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... A lot! I have some great colleagues and mentors who are always pushing me to learn more. Right now, I should be focusing on learning the ins-and-outs of MongoDB!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I may not be able to solve the major bug in your code (yet?), but I believe that documentation is an important part of any project that will see user interaction, and I can contribute there!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my two cats!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me a message on LinkedIn or Twitter!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Writing about myself is _really_ hard!
